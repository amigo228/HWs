                    <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                        instructions, they've moved to <span class="underline">their own section</span>. Continue
                        reading for an introduction to the
                        documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>

                    <h2 class="digits digit2">CORE COMPONENTS</h2>
                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform's native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform's APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next
                        section. But first, let's cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <div class="child-container">
                    <h2 class="digits digit3">REACT FUNDAMENTALS</h2>
                    <p>React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>

                    <p>We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                        examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                        elements inside JavaScript
                        like so: <span class="bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>. The React docs
                        have <span class="underline">a comprehensive
                            guide
                            to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                        variables
                        inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
                        braces inside <span class="bg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                        how components
                        render, state is like a component's personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
                        that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
                        memory!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="child-container">
                    <h2 class="digits digit4">HANDLING TEXT INPUT</h2>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
